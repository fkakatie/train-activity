# Train Activity #

Enjoy this fictional train schedule. Even add your own train, if you dare. :train2:

## What this project does ## 

This project stores user data in and retrieves data from [`Firebase`](https://firebase.google.com/). Time is manipulated and parsed using [`Moment.js`](https://momentjs.com/). `jQuery` is used to display information in the `DOM` and the user form is contained in a `modal`. For no discernable reason, a `hue-rotate filter` has been added to the page and both the page and modal header colors are manipulated with a `setInterval timer` every five seconds.

## How users can get started with this project ## 

1. **[Open the Train Schedule](https://fkakatie.github.io/train-activity/)**.
    - All train data in `Firebase` is pushed to the train schedule table.

2. **Add a train of your own**.
    - At the touch of a button, a modal form will appear, allowing you to enter a new train. 

3. **Lookup your train**!
    - Watch the train schedule update to display your recent entry/entries.
